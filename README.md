# Genetic Algorithm: Super Gene Mapper

* Over the last decades, molecular cloning has transformed biological sciences. The field has attracted many scientist and implementing the same in numerous fields. The use of recombinant DNA, genome therapy, gene editing has successfully started to enter the field of cellular engineering. Due to the emergence of technology and research done we are able to find cure for few of the diseases but it takes years for any ground-breaking result to develop by a human. What if humans had help from computers who would analyse and provide us the solutions to finding cure. What if we build an algorithm that when given boundary values and restriction will calculate and predict the most immune cell from millions, which could be multiplied in order to develop the arsenal to fight against common diseases permanently. Our application is one such sample on how we can apply genetic algorithm to find cure for any disease out of million possible blood samples.

# Areas to focus

* Building an algorithm to find the most immune cell across different generations.
* Implement proper molecular cloning to build next generations.

# Conclusion

* This appilcation helps in finding the best traits present in human geno, which can in turn be mutated in real life to find the cure for any disease.
